  There are plenty of programs for cavity detection out there, so
why would anyone use ANA?
Although ANA is very well capable of detecting new voids, whether they are
cavities, tunnels, etc... 
It was not designed for this task. Also, its output is not going to impress
anyone either.

ANA was designed to perform 2 things well:

1. Non-Delaunay Dynamics (NDD) analysis.
2. Track a specific known cavity.

Leaving out the specific case of NDD analysis, ANA is well suited to easily
define a cavity and track its volume efficiently along a trajectory. It may be
a niche application, but I repeatedly found myself needing exactly that, so I
made ANA.
